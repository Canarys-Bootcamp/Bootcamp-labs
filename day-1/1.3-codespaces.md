# 1.3 Creating your first Codespace

In this hands-on lab your will create your first GitHub Codespace and learn how you can use Codespaces to work from anywhere from a browswer as well as . If you like more background information, please refer to the [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) pages on GitHub Docs. Good luck! 👍

This hands on lab consists of the following steps:
- [Creating first codespace](#creating-first-codespace)
- [Develop in a codespace](#creating-first-codespace)
- [Add devcontainer and devcontainer.json file](#add-devcontainer-and-devcontainer.json-file)
- [If time permits: Customize your worksapce](#if-time-permits-only-customize-your-workspace)

## Creating first codespace
1. Work inside your current repository `Microsoft-Bootcamp/attendee-<your-github-handle>`
2. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
3. In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `github-actions-demo.yml`.
4. Copy the following YAML contents into the `github-actions-demo.yml` file:
```YAML
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "🎉 The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "🐧 This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "🔎 The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: echo "💡 The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "🖥️ The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "🍏 This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `Create` a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click `Propose new file`.

## Develop in a codespace

## Add devcontainer and devcontainer.json file

## If time permits: Customize your worksapce
